In this assignment, we are to demonstrate the techniques to collect, work with, and clean a data set. Thsi is a peer graded assignemnt from Getting and Cleaning Data Course. 
The dataset provided :

This respository consists of the following file

A) README.md - A read me file to state the files and description in this respository

B) run_anaysis.R - Script that performs assignment requirement.
The goal of the code is to perform the following instructions:
	1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each     subject.
  
C) Codebook -Describes the data used in this project, as well as the processing required to create the resulting tidy data set.

D) Data3.txt - Tidy data from script
